The site scales down to a proper width when viewing from a mobile device. This
allows for relative ease of reading the articles and downloading the programs.
The site remains almost exactly the same layout as from a larger screened
device, so the navigation is intuitive enough.
The problems stem from the inclusion of a right column, which uses up valuable
screen space. The buttons on top are manageable but the links when clustered
(especially with features like the keywords) becomes difficult to select with
a small touch screen. This is obviously able to be remedied with a zoom, but
changing it to a more vertical list would make more sense in my opinion. Not a
perfect solution as that would still require the second column.
