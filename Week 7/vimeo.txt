Vimeo is a pretty well designed site. They appear to strive for the "Web 2.0"
model and manage to keep the site easily usable. The navigation is
straight forward and kept from being intrusive. Upon viewing the site, a bit
of hand holding is presented for the users.
On the other hand it sometimes is a bit visually overwhelming. I imagine that
accessibility would be difficult for impaired users. Admittedly the visually
impaired may not be a large consumer base for a video site. My only other
criticism is that the pages could be a little more uniform across the board.
