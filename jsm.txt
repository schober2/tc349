Upon arriving at jasonsantamaria.com, I am immediately discourage by the
apparent lack of consideration for laptop users during the design process.
There is an exorbinant amount of scrolling required and the footer is nearly
capable of filling the entire browser window and has enough on it to be a site
of its own. The is an over-abundance of white -- not at all helped by grey text
in areas -- and the pages feel as though they share no common theme outside of
the header and footer. 

Not all is bad though. The navigation is fairly easy, and scrolling aside I
feel I am able to locate what I am looking for with general ease. The mixture
of content keeps the pages interesting and there is a good separation between
the items on each page. The filtering on the articles page works well and
has a lot of potential; a few unused filters and incorporation into the home
page -- which has much of the information is duplicated -- could go a long
way. Taking everything into consideration, some design aspects were very well
executed and the others that fell short may have been caught by a peer review.
