    All I can say loading up chartbeat.com is, "wow, information overload."
The moving background animations really draw your attention away from the
fairly interesting statistical data that they are trying to convey. Aside from
that, the layout itself is reasonable and without signing up for a trial,
navigation is overt and simple.
    Working with servers on a daily basis, I have to say that this is exactly
the type of presentation that gets to system administrators. Resources are
limited and once you've dropped the bad first impression, it is an uphill
struggle.  That aside, they do a relatively good job of displaying that the
statistics provided can be pertinent and when good information meets good
planning in the business world, there is a lot of money to be made.
