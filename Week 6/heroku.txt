     Heroku.com is a well laid out site -- with a few minor hang ups. The
Asian influence gives the site a bit of uniqueness. The site is easy to
navigate, with a lot of accessible information. The graphics are helpful when
explaining and useful when interactive. They make contacting them easy and
pricing easy to find. Always good things to implement when trying to sell a
product.
     The downfalls of the site come from the lack of mobile site (as far as I
could discern). The formatting does not lend to smaller screen resolutions, so
as they are a vendor, I see that as a poor decision not to make mobile site.
The contrast is not wonderful, which, while it looks cool, may impede those
with visual disabilities.  

    I made several changes to my site. The first objective was to make it
align more centrally. Next I made modifications to be more flexible as far as
screen resolutions. I added a couple images from subtlepatterns.com to add a
little more polish to the site as well. With the current content, the single
column style seems most appropriate. This may change as I add to the site.
