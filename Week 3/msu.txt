MSU's page is fairly well put together.  The first thing I check is
readability which is decent. The next thing I look at is the navigation, which
is intuitive and pretty well thought out. The page formats well and they
include media to spice up the page.
While the media adds some pizzazz to the page, I am not personally a fan of
the large animated slideshows, they are a bit distracting at best. The
information displayed is a bit of a scatter shot, which makes sense at a
university level, but also tends to leave the page feeling cluttered. Overall
the site is pretty well laid out, but the front page is a little too much
shock without bringing me the awe.
