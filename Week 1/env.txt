I chose vim for my environment. There are a few reasons I did this. The first
is that I am very familiar with vim. I use it on a daily basis for writing
emails (in conjunction with mutt) and for server management and configuration.
Another reason that I am using it is because I believe it does one of the
best jobs of syntax highlighting of editors I have used. Vim also supports
macros, visual mode, regex, and easy access to the console from a file.
