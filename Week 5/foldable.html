    <h1>Foldable.me</h1>
    <p>I feel like the process was a little challenging in the sense that it is difficult to map a site. As with web crawlers, there is an element of how deep through the page is truly relevant to what you are looking for. It is a little interesting to see the different thought processes people use for sorting. This page was not terribly complex, so most any navigation (within reason) would probably work.</p>
    <p>There were some marked differences in the associations regarding the methods of contact, and where a blog fits in. Some things seemed to be pretty straight forward for everyone, such as putting shopping cart and check out together.  There was also major clustering when it came to things outside of the site itself, such as the social media trio and the Author/Sponser duo. Overall I think the site kept reasonably close to expectations.</p>
