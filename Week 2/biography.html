  <h1>A Bit About Arthur...</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Schober is systems administrator for the MSU College of Engineering. He is drawn to security-related projects and server deployment. He is studying Information and Communication Technology at MSU. In his spare time you'll find Arthur working on cars or at the gym.</p>
  <h2>Review of <a href="http://www.panic.com">Panic.com</a></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panic greets you with a largely graphic interface -- you have to hover over the icons to view the name and function of each program. This makes what they do more prominent on the page. The information is presented in an easy to read and understand manner, with plenty of visual aides. The design looks like it was heavily influenced by a desire to make it touchscreen friendly for mobile device users.</br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the flip side, the graphics could stand to be sped up and the wording could be slightly less simplistic. I also suspect that as they produce relatively technical programs, their user base would prefer a little more information on the page at any given time. The only other concern I would bring to attention is that the design could flow a bit better between the landing page and the application info pages.</br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I would say that the site does a good job at marketing to its target audience and manages to provide a nice user interface.
