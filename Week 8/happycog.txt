Happy cog is a fairly cleverly designed site. The navigation is extremely
straight forward and easy to use. By staying on the same page it gives the
site almost a stream of consiousness feel, being able to bounce around so
easily. The content is straight foward and concise and multimedia elements are
introduced not intrusively.
Gripes about the site include the header and footer. The navbar is great, but
the header and footer being planted at the ends of the page and  static take
away from it a little. Other than that, a little more texture in the white
space and not using dashes would fit in with the rest of the site a little
more. Overall a well designed site.
