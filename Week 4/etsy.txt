The Etsy page uses a relatively simplistic and straight forward design.  The
navigation is very straight forward. Minimalistic menus leave no room to the
imagination as to what you are doing. The media is relevant and does not
interfere with intuitiveness or readability.
I could stand to have a little less white on the page. I find high contrast
light on dark easier to look at. The fixed width can make the page slightly
awkward to look at depending on browser dimensions. Aside from these couple
gripes, I like the simplistic charm and which more sites would do something
similar -- as clutter creates opportunity for confusion to rear it's head.
