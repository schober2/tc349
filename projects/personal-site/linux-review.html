    <p>You're wondering why someone like me would devote a page that could be explaining how awesome I am, would be using it to describe open-source operating systems. I'll tell you why. It doesn't matter how baller you are, why spend money on something you don't have to. I mean let's face it, if you're following the rest of my advice you're so awesome that they should be paying you to use and endorse their product. Sadly, silicon valley isn't full of the sharpest tools in the shed, so free stuff is the next best thing.

      <tr>
        <td>Gentoo</td>
        <td>My personal favorite, you have to compile software and the kernel but it's highly customizable, has good documentation, and has an awesome package management system.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Arch Linux</td>
        <td>Arch is very customizable and well supported. Binary packages make this a better choice for laptop users concerned with updating on the go.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FreeBSD</td>
        <td>A solid OS, licensing allows the use of ZFS where Linux does not. A separate base system makes it harder to nerf.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>Backtrack</td>
       <td>Because who doesn't love breaking into <del>their neighbor's</del> their own networks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <td>Red Hat variants</td>
       <td>Well supported and offer the Red Hat experience without the cost (Fedora, CentOS, etc.)</td>
