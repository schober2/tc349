    <h2>Because you know you've always wanted to be...</h2>
    <p>Here are a few things you can do right away to be awesome:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Upon meeting people, let them know you are awesome</li>
      <li>Afterwards, do not let people forget that you are awesome</li>
      <li>Being right is awesome, know that you are right</li>
      <li>If you're not right, you're not listening to point 3</li>
      <li>Occasionally, some people will doubt you, just ignore them, they're wrong</li>
      <li>Make awesome lists about how to be awesome</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you've gotten that down, you may be ready for advanced techniques:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Associate with someone who is awesome (if I'm not around find someone kind of awesome)</li>
      <li>Convince people your whip is awesome (even if it's just a huffy)</li>
      <li>Act like me (I'm pretty much the epitome of awesomeness)</li>
