  MSU's mobile site is fairly well put together. The colors have enough
contrast to be easily read, while avoiding looking boring. The secondary and
tertiary pages all seem to be fairly easily navigated with a mobile device, so
you aren't hit up with any surprises. Each page is tailored to the content
quite well as well.
  The default ordering of the icons seems a little less than intuitive, but
with so few, it's not as relevant. Being able to customize the home screen is
a nice feature, but not one that I'm sure is worth the time with the limited
amount of options from the home screen.
  The biggest thing I would like to see is a little more uniformity with the
Library site. When it dumps you there, you are left with a link at the bottom
of the screen to go back, but it would be better suited as a button.  Overall
I would probably say the mobile site is easier to navigate, even on a desktop,
than the desktop site.
