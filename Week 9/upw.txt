United Pixel Workers have a very image oriented site. That has its pros and
cons. Despite that, the site scales quite well and is well organized. I think
the site would probably work well on a mobile device for the most part. The
providence of an interactive social media experience with their roll call is
interesting.
The title bar is a little off putting to me, as the format changes for little
reason for a couple pages. The inclusion of pixelivery can make navigation
a bit frustrating as you are not really informed you're leaving the page. Once
you do, you are presented with a similarly styled page without return
navigation. Overall I think the site was put together well and only falls
short on a few navigational discrepancies.
