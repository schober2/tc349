    <h1>Project</h1>
    <p>For my final project, I would like to continue working on my personal site. I would like to make it more fully featured, but that will vary with the amount of things we go over in class.</p>
    <p>Due to the rather abstract nature of the pages, grouping is not as straight forward as it might be for some other sites. What I have in mind, what people infer from the titles, and what I will end up producing are likely very different things. A few patterns did emerge, Some pointing towards pushing the pages directly about me together as well as things like what is and is not awesome.</p>
    <p><i>The groupings are horizontal in the following:</i></p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td> Contact </td> <td> How I became so awesome </td> <td> Things I do because I'm awesome </td> <td> Why I am awesome </td> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> How you can become awesome </td> <td> When is it appropriate to flex your awesomeness </td> <td> Where is it easiest to display awesomeness </td>  <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Main Page </td> <td> What does it mean to be awesome </td> <td> What is not awesome </td>  <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Other Things almost as awesome as me </td> <td> Who else is awesome </td>  <td></td> <td></td>
